# react-portfolio

## Description 
My React Portfolio is a Reactjs version of my vanilla javascript portfolio. It features single page rendering. My motivation for creating this application was to be able to create my protfolio in React to show future employers that I am capable of utilizing React and it's tools. During development I learned how to create a navigation header to render different pages on a singular page using the onClick function to change the sections. Though during development I struggled with creating the message alert when an invalid email is inputted. Though through some research and reading documentation I was able to solve my problem. 

## Future Development

For future development I plan on creating a more robust UI that is more mobile friendly, especially the contact section. I am going to be adding a backend server to help potential employers actually utilize the Contact Me section. I am also going to be adding more to my About me page, updating my Portfolio with more relevant projects, as well as inserting my real resume into the resume section! There is also a problem with the message section within the contact section where when no message is inputted, the page does not notify you.
